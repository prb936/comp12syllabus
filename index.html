		<dt> Data </dt> 
		<dd> Data is the raw fact about anything which is unprocessed, un-interpreted or unorganized, but able to organize into useful information. For Example: Hari, Manager, Pokhara, 5 etc. </dd>
		<dt> Information </dt>
		<dd> When raw data is processed and changed it into meaning data, then the meaningful data is called information. Information is processed, interpreted or organized data. </dd>
		<dt> Features of Information </dt>
		<dd> Information is valuable when it possesses characteristics like accuracy, relevance, completeness, timeliness, and accessibility. It should be easy to understand and cost-effective, ensuring it's presented in a clear and concise manner, avoiding bias or errors. </dd>
		<h3> <dt> Database and its Purpose: </dt> </h3>
		 A database is a large collection of interrelated data of certain place, person or things in such a way that it can be easily access by an application program like DBMS. For Example: candidates of SLC exam, users of Facebook, users of NTC/NCELL etc.

		<h3> <dt> Terminologies in Database </dt> </h3>
	<dt> Table </dt>
		<dd> In a well-designed database, each table stores data about a particular subject, such as employees or products. A table has records (rows) and fields (columns). </dd>
	<dt> Field </dt>
		<dd> Fields have different types of data, such as text, numbers, dates, and hyperlinks. Fields have different types of data, such as text, numbers, dates, and hyperlinks. </dd>
	<dt> Record </dt>
		<dd> Record is a collection of related fields which represents a complete unit of information </dd>
	<dt> Tuple </dt>
		<dd> A tuple, also known as a record or row, is a basic unit of data in a relational database management system (DBMS). </dd>
	<dt> Object</dt>
		<dd> A database object is anything that is used to store or manipulate data. These can include tables, indexes, sequences, and more. </dd>
	<dt> Keys</dt>
		<dd> In database management systems (DBMS), keys are essential components used to uniquely identify records (rows) within a table and establish relationships between different tables. They play a crucial role in maintaining data integrity, ensuring uniqueness, and enabling efficient data retrieval.  </dd>
	<dt> Data Dictionary</dt>
		<dd> In DBMS, a data dictionary is a centralized repository of information about data, including its meaning, relationships, usage, and format. </dd>
	</dl>			
<h3>  Database Management System (DBMS) </h3>
	<dd> Introduction: A database management system (DBMS) is a software package designed to define, manipulate,
retrieve and manage data in a database. A DBMS generally manipulates the data itself, the data
format, field names, record structure and file structure. It also defines rules to validate and
manipulate this data. </dd>
	<dd>
	Advantages: 
	<ol type="I">
	<li> Improved data Security
	<li> Data retreival
	<li> Improved desicion making
	<li> Better data sharing facility
</ol>
	</dd>
<dd> 
	Disadvantages:
	<ol type="I">
	<li> Complexity
	<li> Large size
	<li> Higher impact of a failure
	<li> Significant cost of DBMS
	</ol>
	</dd>

	<h3> <dt> Types of Database Model  </h3> </dt>
	<dt> Hierarchical databases </dt>
		<dd> It is one of the oldest database model developed by IBM for information Management System. In a hierarchical database model, the data is organized into a tree-like structure. In simple language we can say that it is a set of organized data in tree structure.
This type of Database model is rarely used nowadays. Its structure is like a tree with nodes representing records and branches representing fields. The windows registry used in Windows XP is an example of a hierarchical database. Configuration settings are stored as tree structures with nodes. </dd>
	<dt> Network databases </dt>
		<dd> This is looks like a Hierarchical database model due to which many time it is called as modified version of Hierarchical database. Network database model organised data more like a graph and can have more than one parent node. The network model is a database model conceived as a flexible way of representing objects and their relationships. </dd>
	<dt> Relational databases </dt>
		<dd> The various software systems used to maintain relational databases are known as a relational database management system (RDBMS). In this model, data is organised in rows and column structure i.e., two-dimensional tables and the relationship is maintained by storing a common field. It consists of three major components.
In relational model, three key terms are heavily used such as relations, attributes, and domains. A relation nothing but is a table with rows and columns. </dd>
 </dl>
 
 <dl>
	<h3> <dt> Integrity Constraints and Types:  </h3> </dt>
	<dt> Domain </dt>
		<dd> Domain constraints are a type of integrity constraint that ensure the values stored in a column (or attribute) of a database are valid and within a specific range or domain. </dd>
	<dt> Entity </dt>
		<dd> Entity integrity constraints state that primary key can never contain null value because primary key is used to determine individual rows in a relation uniquely, if primary key contains null value then we cannot identify those rows. </dd>
	<dt> Referential integrity </dt>
		<dd> Referential integrity constraints are rules that ensure relationships between tables remain consistent. They enforce that a foreign key in one table must either match a value in the referenced primary key of another table or be NULL </dd>
	<dt> Keys </dt>
		<dd> Key constraints ensure that certain columns or combinations of columns in a table uniquely identify each row. These rules are essential for maintaining data integrity and preventing duplicate or ambiguous records. </dd>	
</dl>
 
 <dl>
	<h3> <dt> Normalization </h3> </dt>
	<dt> Introduction </dt>
		<dd> Normalization is a systematic approach to organize data within a database to reduce redundancy and eliminate undesirable characteristics such as insertion, update, and deletion anomalies. </dd>
	<dt> Normal Forms </dt>
		<dd> Normal Forms are different stages of normalization, and each stage imposes certain rules to improve the structure and performance of a database. </dd>
	<dt> 1NF: First Normal Form</dt>
		<dd> A table is in 1NF if it satisfies the following conditions:
All columns contain atomic values (i.e., indivisible values).
Each row is unique (i.e., no duplicate rows).
Each column has a unique name.
The order in which data is stored does not matter. </dd>
	<dt> 2NF: ELimating Partial Dependency</dt>
		<dd> A relation is in 2NF if it satisfies the conditions of 1NF and additionally. No partial dependency exists, meaning every non-prime attribute (non-key attribute) must depend on the entire primary key, not just a part of it. </dd>
	<dt> 3NF</dt>
		<dd> A relation is in 3NF if it satisfies 2NF and additionally, there are no transitive dependencies. In simpler terms, non-prime attributes should not depend on other non-prime attributes. </dd>
	<dt> Advantages of Normalization:</dt>
		<ol type="A">
	<li>Reduces Data Redundancy: Duplicate data is stored efficiently, saving disk space and reducing inconsistency. </li>
	<li>Improves Data Integrity: Ensures the accuracy and consistency of data by organizing it in a structured manner.
	<li> Simplifies Database Design: By following a clear structure, database designs become easier to maintain and update.
		</ol>

	<dt> Disadvantages of Normalization: </dt>
		<ol type="A">
	<li> Complex Queries: Too many tables may result in multiple joins, making queries slow and difficult to manage. </li>
	<li> Performance Overhead: Additional processing required for joins in overly normalized databases may hurt performance, especially in large-scale systems. </li>
		</ol>

	<h3> <dt> Database Security: </dt> </h3>
	<dt> Introduction </dt>
	<dd> Database security refers to the measures, policies, and practices used to protect databases from unauthorized access, misuse, or destruction. It involves securing the data within the database, the database management system (DBMS), and any associated applications. </dd>
	 <br>
     <dt>Challenges </dt>
		<ol type="I">
		<li> Data quality 
		<li> Intellectual property rights  
		<li> Authentication and Authorization 
		<li> Encryption 
		</ol>
	<dt> Roles of Database Administrator(DBA) </dt>
	<dd> A database administrator, or DBA for short, designs, implements, administers, and monitors data management systems and ensures consistency, quality, security, and compliance with rules and regulations.
	<br>
The role of DBA has evolved into a mission-critical function. A DBA in database management involves the installing, configuring, monitoring, maintaining, and improving the performance of databases and data stores, according to Skills Framework for the Information Age–SFIA 8. A solution architect may design the overall framework or structure of the databases, but the job of implementing and maintaining belongs to DBA roles. </dd>
